This is Project 0 of the Udacity Android Nanodegree Program
The goals of this are:
* For me to build an app layout that showcases the apps that I will build across my Nanodegree journey.
* To introduce me to the process of submitting a project for review. I will be expected to submit projects for review throughout the program, so it's important that I go through the process early.
* To familiarize myself with the experience of receiving feedback on my work from Udacity reviewers. Sharing and receiving feedback on my code is a key part of the Nanodegree program.
